# CARLA Joystick-Controlled Simulation with Sensor and Collision Logging
This project is a Python-based CARLA simulation that integrates joystick control (e.g., Logitech G920), multi-camera visualization (including Bird's Eye View), autonomous vehicle and pedestrian spawning, real-time collision detection, dynamic weather changes, and video/data logging
